# Beta 0.1

This is the very first edition of my attempt to revive an old, now removed Chrome extension that enables dark mode for in-browser PDFs. It has bugs, it has debug prints, and it throws errors, but it works.

## To install:

1. In Chrome (or Edge), click the extensions button
2. Click "Manage Extensions"
3. Toggle on Developer Mode in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked" in the top left
5. Point to the pdf-darkmode directory
