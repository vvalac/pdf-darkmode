# Beta 0.2

_Due to how Chrome handles PDFs, dark mode is handled by inverting colors. The only customization that can be done is overall color balancing_

**Beta 0.1:** Very rough and ready, many debug prints and extra comments. No ability to toggle between sepia mode. Lots of bugs.

**Beta 0.2:** Core functionality is present, including the ability to toggle between Sepia and Standard dark modes.

**Beta 0.3:** Button text dynamically changes based on dark mode and pdf detection.
- Known bug: It is possible to force a sepia state mismatch by toggling and flipping between tabs.
