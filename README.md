# Beta 0.2

_Due to how Chrome handles PDFs, dark mode is handled by inverting colors. The only customization that can be done is overall color balancing_

**Beta 0.1:** Very rough and ready, many debug prints and extra comments. No ability to toggle between sepia mode. Lots of bugs.

**Beta 0.2:** Core functionality is present, including the ability to toggle between Sepia and Standard dark modes.

# To install:

1. In Chrome (or Edge), click the extensions button
